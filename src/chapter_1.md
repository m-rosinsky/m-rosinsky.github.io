# Why (the heck) Am I Learning C?

I asked this same question to myself when I had to take _CS 3100 - Systems Programming_, which was exclusively taught in C.

I also asked similar questions such as:

- Do companies even use C anymore?
- If C is so complicated, why can't I just use Python or JS?

If you find yourself asking these questions as well, I may just have some answers for you that will hopefully allow you to see why just going through the motions of a C programming class may be doing yourself a disservice.

## The Short Answer

So why do I have to learn this language in order to get my CS degree?

I'll put the answer that I found as a CS student simply:

> C allows us to understand the _how_ when it comes to programming, instead of just the _what_

Chances are, this isn't your first programming class in undergrad, and if it is, I may even consider that a better place to start than how most universities approach teaching programming.

Likely, our undergrad started with a higher-level language like Python or Javascript, because they tend to be lighter introductions to programming concepts.

Learning languages like these are useful, but they tend to answer a lot of _what_ questions, such as:

- _What are `for` loops_?
- _What are variables_?
- _What is inheritence_?

When a student learns a language that is a bit lower-level, such as C, we force ourselves to learn _how_ things work, not just _what_ things work.

When we learn to drive a car, sure we can press the pedals and turn the wheel, but if we don't understand what's going on under the hood, our chances of fixing things, or making the next best car, are slim to none.

Us, as software engineers, are called to understand how software works, under the hood and all, and learning C forces us to do that.

## But C is Old!

Yep, C really is the boomer generation of programming languages.

The problem is, modern languages like Python, or even C++ abstract some core concepts away from us as programmers that C forces us to tackle.

The point isn't that C is that _only_ option to write production-level code, of course it isn't, but as students we should embrace the opportunity to lift the abstractions so we can actually grasp the concepts.

Then, once we understand these things, moving to the more modern languages is a breeze, and gives us natural intuition into what might be going on when our programs break.
