Hey everyone, thanks for checking out my tutorial.

My name is Mike Rosinsky. I'm a software engineer on the X Developer Platform team, and I wanted to make a blog-style page to showcase some fun demos and other things relating to the API.

This doesn't intend to serve as a replacement for docs, but maybe can give some good insight into what you can create with the APIs that X offers.
