# Mike's C Programming Tutorial

> _Writing code is hard, but learning to code doesn't have to be_

Hey everyone, thanks for checking out my tutorial.

My name is Mike Rosinsky. I'm a software engineer, and a recent CS grad.

| _My sick heel click at graduation_ |

Having just gone through my undergrad only a few years ago, I wanted to throw together some tutorials for others that may be in the same boat I was a few years ago.

My peers would always talk my ear off about how their professor doesn't explain concepts well enough for them to understand. And going through a number of CS and non-CS courses in school, I certainly see where they're coming from.

I have no doubt that professors have an _immense_ amount of knowledge about their respective fields, which is why they became professors.

But teaching is hard, and more importantly, having a good medium for teaching is even harder.

I hope to teach people not only to code, but to enjoy coding, using techniques that myself as a student could understand.

I want to teach not from the perspective of a professor, but from the perspective of a peer - As a fellow software engineer who is still learning myself, and has gone through what current students are currently going through.

I view education as a gift one can give to another.

Therefore, I write these tutorials out of a pure passion project, and because I truly love the field that I'm in and want to share my passion with others.

I'll never put these tutorials behind a paywall, or charge for asking me advice.
